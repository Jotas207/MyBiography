    <h2>My Early Life</h2>
    <pre>
      My Name is Juan Jose Mujica, I was born 15 years ago, in March 9th, 2007, at the General Hospital of
      Medellin, in Medellin, Antioquia. According to my parents, I said my first word
      which was "mamá" when I was around 5 months old, and first walked when I was 14 months old, my 
      parents told me I liked to eat a lot, so I was a fat baby. When I was 2 years old, I entered the Pequeños
      Halcones kindergarten, a kindergarten to which my mum turned out to be the principal, in this 
      kindergarten, I met my 2 best friends back then, who were called Jacobo and Nicolas. My Parents wanted
      me to practice sports, so they gave me some options to choose, to their surprise, I chose tennis
      rather than soccer since I liked it a lot. I also developed a strong interest in space and I even learned
      the solar system planets in order.

    <h2>First school</h2>
    <pre>
      When I was 4 years old, I entered my first school, which was called Gimnasio Vermont, while there
      I made many friends that I still talk to to this day, in this school I learned speaking english 
      very well, since all subjects where in english, except for spanish class, it even got to the point 
      that I forgot some few words in spanish and I wasn't too good with spanish writting. During this age
      I also took my first flight in a helicopter, since my dad was a pilot of a combat helicopter, he once
      took me for a ride with my Brother. My parents also discovered I was a very psychorigid person, and
      I was also very perfectionist, this was because I'd rather finish an school assignment perfectly and
      nicely than going out for a break, I also turned out to be very serious and I got mad very easily.
      In this time, my brother also entered the same school, so I always enjoyed helping him with his 
      homework, that does not happen nowadays though. Apart from tennis, I also liked practicing golf, so
      I started taking lessons.

    <h2>New Home</h2>
          <pre>
            Unfortunately, due to my dad's work, we had to move several times throughout our lives, the first time
            I was around 7 years old, we had to move to Melgar, Tolima, at first it was very difficult since I had 
            to leave all of my friends and neighbors, in addition to this, when I first arrived to Melgar, the heat
            was a very bad issue for me, since I was a little boy who wasn't used to such a level of heat, in fact
            I got very sick just a few weeks after arriving, partly because I'm allergic to mosquitoes and there were 
            plenty of them where I lived. I began studying in a school named Gimnasio Luis F. Pinto.
            It wasn't the best school in the world but it was a decent place to study. When I first got to that
            school I got bullyed by my classmates since my accent (paisa accent) was very different to theirs, I also 
            pretty much had to completely learn spanish, since in my past school everything was done in english, I
            practically had no idea how to write in spanish, time went by and I managed to get a lot of friends, 
            because the school was actually very small and I lived in an airforce residential base, so it was a very
            safe place. Due to the school schedule, I had a lot of free time in the afternoons everyday so I enjoyed
            going out with my friends to play soccer or meet at one of their house to play with nerf guns, we
            also liked to go out for a bike ride around the neighbourhood. I also had my first trip overseas, my 
            family and me went for vacation to the <a class="a" href="hyperlink2.html">United States</a>. We also got a dog, her name is Nirvana, 
            she is a Springer Spaniel and she is 7 years old nowadays.

    <h2>New Home again</h2>
    <pre>
      The second time we moved, I was around 9 years old, we had to move to Bogota, I entered the Gimnasio
      Campestre los Arrayanes in 4th grade, I didn't have too much trouble getting new friends, I lasted in this school
      until 5th grade, during this time, my brother had trouble with his partners since some kids bullyed him,
      so my dad decided to sign us up in taekwondo classes, so I've been training taekwondo since then and I have
      now a red belt. I also continued training tennis but unfortunately I had to stop training since I moved
      to another part of the city, where I still live today. I also went to United States for the second time
      with my parents, my brother and my aunt.

      (Click Image) Due to the quality of the school I was in, my parents decided to get me to a different school, this is 
      when some friends of the family introduced us to the GCRB, although it was really far from my house, my parents 
      thought it was a good idea, and I liked the school, as soon as I entered, I met my first and actual best friend,
      Yamel larrarte, he was the first guy to ever talk to me, it wasn't too long before I was friend with everyone on
      the classroom, I enjoyed classes and I'm doing very well academically. I continued practicing taekwondo but I 
      had to quit tennis since I moved from my previous house, the pandemic hit when I was in 7th grade, it really
      impacted our lives since due to quarantine I had to temporarily quit all of my sport activities, but in the
      good side, I learned how to cook, and I discovered I'm pretty good at it, it is one of the things I enjoy
      doing the most, apart from programming and playing basketball. Currently I'm in 9th grade and I'm very close to
      my friends.
